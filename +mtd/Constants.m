    %   Dimensions
    %       In the documentation comments below, dimensions are defined
    %       using the following shorthand:
    %           - M: Mass
    %           - L: Length
    %           - T: Time
    %           - K: Temperature
    %       The superscripts for each of these are given for each quantity
    %       so that if (non-)dimensionalization is needed, you don't need
    %       to search on wikipedia. You're welcome.

    properties (Constant)
        % Universal Constant of Gravitation
        %
        %   This is also known as the Newtonian Constant of Gravitation and
        %   the Cavendish Gravitational Constant. In the classical
        %   (Newtonian) formulation of gravity, this value serves as the
        %   constant of proportionality between the force exterted between
        %   two bodies and the sum of their products divided by the square
        %   of the distance between them.
        %
        %   Note that the value of this constant is only really known to
        %   about four significant figures. Therefore, if its use can be
        %   avoided it should be.

        % Astronomical Unit
        %
        %   Unit of length that is about equal to the distance from the
        %   Earth to the Sun. According to WikiPedia, the distance from the
        %   Earth to the Sun varies by about 3% over the course of a year
        %   so this value could be (in theory) about 3% off the distance
        %   for any given epoch. However, the use case of this unit is that
        %   it is a convenient scaling factor for distances of solar system
        %   magnitudes as it is officially defined.

        % Standard Gravity

        %   Also called Standard Acceleration Due to Gravity or Standard
        %   Acceleration of Free Fall. This is the "nominal" gravitational
        %   acceleration of an object in a vacuum near the Earth's surface
        %   according to Wikipedia. Note that this is a _defined_ quantity,
        %   not a universal constant.
